# Check it..

 What I got here is a tested and working, Dolibarr Suite, using a MariaDB database, working in Docker, behind a Traefik Proxy, with Watchtower enabled with volumes attached to a Synology NAS NFS share.. Did I mention I added an .env file for easier configuration? All buttoned up and ready to deploy in a small business or home environment. 

### Requirements:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Traefik Proxy Container - GITHUB_PROJECT_URL (Note: If you already have an existing Traefik Proxy, you can use that instead. Just make sure to modify this project's compose file to reflect your environment.)
- Watchtower Container - GITHUB_PROJECT_URL (Note: If you already have an existing Watchtower container, you can use that instead. Just make sure to modify this project's compose file to reflect your environment.)
